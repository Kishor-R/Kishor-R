- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kishor-R
- 👀 thank you for visiting my profile!
- 🌱 I’m currently a MSc student in Robotics at cranfield university and working on the project "Multi-camera calibration for 3D object reconstruction"
- 💞️ I have had the journey of working on the following amazing academic projects and other interesting works on the sideline that helped me develop my coding skills.
- Derive the kinematics and design feedback control for 6-DOF manipulator,
- classification using different ML algorithms
- proposal of a design concept for human-robot interaction for fuselage assembly using VR
- measurement of various objects using OpenCV and C++ without using any automation tools
- implementing extended Kalman filter, path planning using dubins path and path following using carrot chase algorithm on a unicycle robot model.
